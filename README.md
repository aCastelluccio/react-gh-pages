This project serves as a companion application to Canvas Instructure.

The idea is to allow for a staging ground before the grades are actually submitted to the students, allowing for a student grader to do preliminary grades and a teacher to do the actual submitting.

To use the web-app, head over to https://acastelluccio.github.io/react-gh-pages/

The first time you login you will be prompted to enter your api key from canvas.
To get this:

Go to the canvas dashboard
Click Account on the left 
Click Settings
Under Approved Integrations, click new access token, type in a purpose and feel free to put an expiration date
Copy the token directly into our site

Now you can see all of the classes that you are registered as a grader for, click the class and assignments with rubrics will show up, and then go through the grading!


Good luck!
